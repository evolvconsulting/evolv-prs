description: "Drive this repo's task tracker with the quest CLI instead of editing backlog/tracker state directly. Use whenever creating, listing, viewing, editing, completing, or archiving tasks, drafts, milestones, or decisions in a Quest-initialized workspace. Run `quest instructions --list` for the workflow guides and `quest help [command]` for full usage."

# quest — tracker CLI

This skill is a pointer, not a manual. The guidance ships inside the CLI, so it cannot
drift from the release you have installed:

- `quest instructions --list` — the workflow guides, one line each.
- `quest instructions overview` — start here.
- `quest instructions` — the versioned protocol block Quest manages in your instructions file (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or GEMINI.md).
- `quest help [command]` — exact flags; `quest manifest --json` for the machine registry.

`quest dashboard` — then `full`, `fleet`, `local` or a task id, in any combination — opens
the board in ONE call to `mcp__opum-quest__dashboard` (`scope`, `full`, `task`), so "quest
dashboard full fleet" asks for both. Every argument that does not start at `dashboard`
goes to the `quest` CLI as before — "quest board" included, which the CLI already serves.
Where the tool is unavailable (Claude Code older than 2.1.287, a `claude -p` run, or mods
off), say the pane is unavailable here and answer from the CLI instead.

Drive tracker state through `quest`, never by editing `.quest/` by hand.

Coming from Backlog.md? The `migrate-from-backlog` skill drives
`quest migration backlog` preview, apply, status and rollback.
